# Play Store Market Analysis

In this project, I analyzed data from the Google Play Store to uncover trends in app categories, user ratings, and install patterns. I began by cleaning the raw dataset - removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing formats (e.g., transforming install counts and price columns), and filtering out invalid or inconsistent entries.

**Once cleaned, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends:**

- Which app categories are the most common?

- Which categories have the highest ratings and install counts?

- How paid vs. free apps differ in performance? etc..

*This project helped sharpen my data wrangling and visualization skills, and gave me practice uncovering actionable insights from messy real-world data.*
